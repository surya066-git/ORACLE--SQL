Compulsory exercise
===========================================================================================


In the following you can check on your own whether you completed the compulsory exercises
with the following SQL query:

SELECT object_name "TABLE", created FROM user_objects 
WHERE object_type='TABLE' AND object_name LIKE 'PRACTICE%'
ORDER BY object_name;
*******************************************************************************************

LIKES (name, fruits)
----------------------

NAME     FRUITS
---------------
Piglet   apple
Piglet   pear
Piglet   raspberry
Winnie   apple
Winnie   pear
Kanga    apple
Tiger    apple
Tiger    pear

-- DROP TABLE likes; (drop the table if it exists already)

-- Create your own empty table.
CREATE TABLE LIKES (NAME varchar(14), FRUITS varchar(14));

-- Insert rows into the table.

   insert into LIKES values ('Piglet','apple');
   insert into LIKES values ('Piglet','pear');
   insert into LIKES values ('Piglet','raspberry');
   insert into LIKES values ('Winnie','apple');
   insert into LIKES values ('Winnie','pear');
   insert into LIKES values ('Kanga','apple');
   insert into LIKES values ('Tiger','apple');
   insert into LIKES values ('Tiger','pear');

commit;  -- see later, but don't forget, it is important
-- grant select on LIKES to public;

SELECT * FROM likes;  -- query your own table

-- Query the table of the instructor: 
SELECT * FROM nikovits.likes;

-- Create your own table from an existing one: (don't forget to drop the old one if exists)
CREATE TABLE likes AS SELECT * FROM nikovits.likes;
