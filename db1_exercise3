Compulsory exercise 
===========================================================================================

You can check whether you completed the compulsory exercises with the following SQL query:

SELECT object_name "TABLE", created FROM user_objects 
WHERE object_type='TABLE' AND object_name LIKE 'PRACTICE%'
ORDER BY object_name;
*******************************************************************************************

Try to express the queries in db1_exercise2.txt in relational algebra.
For this use the relational algebra calculator -> Relax (see Relax*.* files on homepage)


Queries for the following tables
--------------------------------
NIKOVITS.EMP (empno, ename, job, mgr, hiredate, sal, comm, deptno)
NIKOVITS.DEPT(deptno, dname, loc)
NIKOVITS.SAL_CAT(category, lowest_sal, highest_sal)
---------------------------------------------------

-- (Salary categories)
CREATE TABLE Sal_cat
 (category NUMERIC,       -- salary category (1,2,3 ...)
  lowest_sal NUMERIC,     -- lower bound of the category
  highest_sal NUMERIC     -- upper bound of the category
);

Sal_cat 
-------------
1   700  1200
2  1201  1400
3  1401  2000
4  2001  3000
5  3001  9999


Queries for Built-in Functions (SQL only)
-----------------------------------------
1.  List the employees whose salary is divisible by 15. (use mod function)
2.  List the employees, whose hiredate is greater than 1982.01.01. (use to_date function)
3.  List the employees where the second character of his name is 'A'. (use substr function)
4.  List the employees whose name contains two 'L'-s. (use instr function)
5.  List the last 3 characters of the employees' names. (use substr function)
6.  List the emloyees whose name has a 'T' in the last but one position (position before the last). (use substr function)
7.  List the square root of the salaries rounded to 2 decimals and the integer part of it. (sqrt, round, trunc function)
8.  In which month was the hiredate of ADAMS? (give the name of the month) (date functions)
9.  Give the number of days since ADAMS's hiredate. (date arithmetic)
10. List the employees whose hiredate was Tuesday. (Take care of the length of name_day string!) (to_char function)
11. Give the manager-employee name pairs where the length of the two names are equal. (length function)
12. List the employees whose salary is in category 1. (see Sal_cat table)
13. List the employees whose salary category is an even number. (mod function)
14. Give the number of days between the hiredate of KING and the hiredate of JONES.
15. Give the name of the day (e.g. Monday) which was the last day of the month in which KING's hiredate was. (last_day function)
16. Give the name of the day (e.g. Monday) which was the first day of the month in which KING's hiredate was. (trunc function)
17. Give the names of employees whose department name contains a letter 'C' and whose salary category is >= 4.

18. List the name and salary of the employees, and a charater string where one '#' denotes 1000 (rounded). (rpad function)
(So if the salary is 1800 then print -> '##', because 1800 rounded to thousands is 2.) 

Give the queries below in relational algebra and SQL
----------------------------------------------------
19. Give the name and location of departments having an employee with salary category 1. (dname, loc)
20. Give the name and location of departments having no employee with salary category 1. (dname, loc)
